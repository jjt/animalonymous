{"name":"Animalonymous","tagline":"A node module that maps input strings (ex. user email) to strings of form \"[adjective] [animal]\"","body":"# animalonymous\r\n\r\nAn npm module that takes input strings and hashes them to output strings of the form \"[adjective]\r\n[animal]\". Intended to provide (semi)-anonymous, (semi-)persistent usernames.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n    $> npm install --save animalonymous\r\n\r\n## Usage:\r\n```\r\nvar input = 'test@animalonymous.com',\r\n    output = require('animalonymous')(input);\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Input: \" + input + \", Output: \" + output);\r\n// -> \"Input: test@animalonymous.com, Output: Upset Camel\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nWe have two source arrays comprised of 591 animals and 1344 adjectives which get\r\ncombined for a total of 794,304 unique outputs.\r\nThe main function in `animalonymous` takes an md5 hash of the input, then\r\nconverts the first 8 bytes to a 32-bit integer for selecting the animals, and\r\nthen the next 8 bytes of the hash to a 32-bit integer for the adjectives. It\r\nthen takes these integers and determines indexes for each array by `floor( (int\r\n/ 2^32) * len )`. It then returns `animals[animalsIndex] + \" \"\r\n+adjectives[adjectivesIndex]`.\r\n\r\n### License \r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 jason@jasontrill.com <Jason Trill>;\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
